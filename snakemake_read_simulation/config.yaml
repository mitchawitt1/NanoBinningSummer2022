## A directory which lists a bunch of fasta files that each represent the reference genome of a species. The Snakefile will take all fasta files found in this directory only.
reference_genomes: "/athena/ihlab/store/miw4007/simulation_test/input_seq/cleaned_seqs/" 
## Specify the error profile that Nanosim uses, the following is for metagenomic samples with even abundance distributions
error_profile: "/athena/ihlab/store/miw4007/simulation_test/err_profs/metagenome_ERR3152364_Even/metagenome_ERR3152364_Even"
config_dir: "/nano_config"
## Specify the prefix used for Nanosim files, which should look like "{reads_prefix}_sample0_aligned_reads.fasta"
reads_prefix: "mgERR"
## Average coverage of the Nanosim reads
coverage: 1.0
ART_env: "ART_env"
nano_env: "nanosim_env"
## IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO SPECIFY THE NAME AND LOCATION OF THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO WORK IN, SHOULD BE THE SAME ACROSS CONFIG.YAML FILES
sim_outdir: "/../autobin_output"
